Task - Need to create clone object of student object.

1. Shallow copy
- Student student= new Student(1,"Tejas")
- Student cloneObject=student;

Here if we change in student object or cloneStudent object it will affect in both which is not a good practice.

2. Deep copy

- Create 1 interface StudentPrototype with method createStudent
- This createStudent method will call constructor of Student
- From main we can call this method.
Eg- Student cloneStudent = student.createStudent();

- If we change student or cloneStudent object it will change that object only.

** Here Prototype design pattern comes under creational design pattern as it deals with creation of objects.
